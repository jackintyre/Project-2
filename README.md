# Project-2

Heroku url: https://evening-cove-03792.herokuapp.com/

For project requirements:

The javascript file that generates the pop up cards that show the team is jquery.js

The charts created were: Horizontal Bar chart Bubble chart showing the earnings Candlestick chart showing daily activity for a specific chart Two Bubble charts that show clickable x and Y axes

MONGO DB has 15 stock collections containing 100 records each, taken from alphavantage

Python version for this environment is 3.6.13

Note: the data files in the current repo has been corrupted. In earlier repos the data files were not corrupted, but the data was not verified. To demo the live chart showing earnings, I switched back to an earlier json file that will use the ticker symbol but the bar chart data is not accurate stock information.
